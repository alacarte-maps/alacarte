# What is alaCarte? #

alaCarte is a tile renderer for OpenStreetMap data written in C++11, using Cairo for
rendering and Boost-Spirit for [MapCSS](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS) parsing.

The rendered tiles are served over HTTP using the [Slippy map tilenames](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) convention.

To compute which data is needed for rendering a tile, alaCarte uses a variant of
a kd-Tree.

alaCarte was designed with medium dataset size in mind. On a typical machine with
at leat 8GB RAM, alaCarte can handle a unfiltered export from the federal state
of Baden-Wuerttemberg (Germany).

alaCarte was developed as part of a lab course student software project at [KIT](http://algo2.iti.kit.edu).
For the old project files (mostly in German) see the [old project repository](https://bitbucket.org/TheMarex/alacarte).

## Features ##

* easy to use
* most MapCSS attributes are implemented
* no need to filter OSM exports, you have full access to all attributes at runtime
* stylesheets are updated at runtime (changes are detected automatically)
* tiles can be rendered in groups ("meta tile") to speed up rendering _(not in 0.2)_

# How to build #

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	make

## Dependencies ##
* Cairo (>=1.12.0), Cairomm
* Boost (Spirit)
* SigC++
* libpng
* log4cpp

## Usage ##

(from build directory)

	./alacarte-importer osm_export.osm data.carte
	./alacarte-server -g data.carte -s ../data/mapcss

You can use the test Leaftlet-Page located in *tests/html/Leaflet/index.html*
to view the rendered tiles.

You can download fresh OSM exports from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/).

## Install ##

(as root)

	make install

The config-file is located in */etc/alacarte.conf*. You should make sure the user
running alacarte has permissions to write to the specified directories for caching
and logging.

# To Do #
* Real database backend
* Better font rendering (Pango?)
* Unicode support
* Better label placement (e.g. above icons)
* Implement MapCSS-include
* Better caching of fonts and icons
* Option to "tune" imported data for specific stylesheets
* Speed up tree generation
